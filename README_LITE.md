# 🎒 Pokémon Trainer Platform

_A production-minded Spring Boot 4 backend built with Test-Driven Development._

## What It Is

A REST API that allows Pokémon trainers to manage inventories, trade Pokémon, and participate in a marketplace.

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates **real-world backend engineering practices**:

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Production-parity databases (PostgreSQL everywhere)
- Explicit migrations (Flyway)
- Operability-first design (health checks, CI, Docker)

- Trainer & inventory management
- Pokémon species validation via PokeAPI
- Trading & marketplace workflows
- Integration testing with Testcontainers
- Phased JWT-based security
