# 🏷️ Project Badges

This document is the **authoritative source of truth** for badges used in this repository.

- `README.md` surfaces a **curated subset** of badges intended for first-time readers
  (recruiters, reviewers, new contributors).
- `BADGES.md` documents **what each badge represents**, why it exists, and how to
  maintain or extend the badge set over time.

Badges are treated as **signals**, not decoration.

## ➕ How to Add a New Badge

Only add a badge if the tool or practice is:

- ✅ Already implemented
- ✅ Enforced in CI or exercised in real code paths
- ✅ Meaningful to external readers

### Required process

1. Add the badge **here first** (`BADGES.md`)
2. Document:
   - What it represents
   - Why it matters
   - When it should change
3. Curate a subset into `README.md` if appropriate

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Excluded (For Now)

The following are intentionally **not badged yet**:

- Coverage percentage (until enforced in CI)
- Security / JWT (until authentication is enforced)
- Release / version badges
- Dependency count or tooling vanity badges

---

## 🧭 Design Principle

> Badges should describe **reality**, not intent.

If a badge cannot be defended by code, tests, or CI,
it does not belong in this project.
