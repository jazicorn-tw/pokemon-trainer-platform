# act — example configuration for local CI simulation
#
# Usage:
#   cp .actrc.example ~/.actrc
#
# Notes:
# - ~/.actrc is read automatically by act
# - Do NOT commit ~/.actrc (machine-specific)
# - Applies to all act runs on this machine

# Match GitHub-hosted runner image
-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-latest

# Force CI parity (GitHub runners are amd64)
--platform linux/amd64

# Run runner as root
# (ensures the container can access the Docker daemon regardless of
# socket or context routing)
--container-options "--user 0:0"
