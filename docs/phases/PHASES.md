# 📦 Delivery Phases & Roadmap

## 🎒 Pokémon Trainer Inventory Service

_A Spring Boot 4 backend for managing trainers, Pokémon inventories, trades, and a marketplace — built with strict Test‑Driven Development (TDD)._

This document is the **authoritative delivery contract** for the system.
Each phase is completed **only** when its release criteria are met.

For design rationale and trade‑offs, see **./ARCHITECTURE.md**.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Pokémon Trainer Platform Service** is a Spring Boot 4 backend that lets trainers:

* Register and manage trainer profiles
* Add Pokémon to their inventory (validated via PokeAPI)
* Trade Pokémon with other trainers
* List Pokémon for sale and buy from other trainers
* Authenticate with JWT

The project is built using **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** at all phases.
Each version introduces new functionality only after writing failing tests first.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Workflow

Every feature in this project follows:

1. **Write failing tests** (unit or controller tests)
2. **Implement the minimal passing code**
3. **Refactor with confidence**

No feature is added without tests.

---

## 🧪 Global TDD Rules

* Every feature starts with failing tests
* Minimal implementation to pass tests
* Refactors only happen with green tests
* No phase is complete without release criteria

---

## 🔰 Phase 0 — Project Skeleton (v0.0.1)

> ⚠️ **Environment requirement:** Phase 0 tests require **Docker** (or **Colima on macOS**) because the project uses **Testcontainers** for PostgreSQL-backed integration tests.  
> If Docker is not running, Phase 0 **must fail** — this is intentional and documents production parity.

* Full walkthrough: [`PHASE_0.md`](PHASE_0.md)

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Establish a **runnable, testable Spring Boot 4 service** with production-aware scaffolding and strict infrastructure parity from day one.

Phase 0 exists to:

* Prove the application can boot end-to-end
* Lock in database, migration, testing, and quality-gate strategy
* Prevent later architectural drift
* Ensure CI and local environments behave identically

No business logic is introduced in this phase.

---

### 🧱 Phase-Gate ADRs

The following Architectural Decision Records **must be accepted and committed**
before Phase 0 is considered complete:

* **ADR-000** — Quality gates & local/CI parity (pre-commit, CI authority)
* **ADR-001** — PostgreSQL as the only database (no H2, no in-memory fallbacks)
* **ADR-002** — Flyway for schema migrations (explicit, versioned SQL)
* **ADR-003** — Testcontainers for all integration tests
* **ADR-004** — Actuator health endpoints + Docker health checks
* **ADR-005** — Phased security approach (dependencies now, enforcement later)

Failure to comply with any ADR invalidates Phase 0.

---

### 🧪 TDD Contract (Phase 0)

Phase 0 is implemented **test-first**. The following tests define the phase boundary:

1. **Context load test**
   * Verifies Spring context boots
   * Confirms PostgreSQL + Flyway wiring
   * Fails fast if Testcontainers or Docker is misconfigured

2. **Public liveness endpoint**
   * `GET /ping` returns `"pong"`
   * No authentication
   * Used by humans, CI, and container health checks

3. **Operational health**
   * `GET /actuator/health` returns `UP`
   * Database health included
   * Mirrors production readiness checks

4. **Container health**
   * Dockerfile includes healthcheck
   * Docker Compose respects health status
   * CI depends on container health, not timing hacks

---

## 📦 Dependencies (Phase 0 Only)

Baseline dependencies introduced in this phase:

* Spring Boot Web
* Spring Boot Data JPA
* Bean Validation
* Spring Boot Actuator
* PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
* Flyway Core
* Spring Boot Test
* Testcontainers
* PostgreSQL module
* JUnit Jupiter integration

No optional, convenience, or feature-level dependencies are permitted.

---

### ✅ Release Criteria (Phase 0 Complete)

Phase 0 is complete **only when all criteria pass**:

* Docker / Colima running locally
* Application boots without manual setup
* Local quality gates pass (ADR-000)
* `./gradlew test` passes using Testcontainers PostgreSQL
* `/ping` responds with `"pong"`
* `/actuator/health` reports `UP`
* CI pipeline passes with no environment-specific hacks
* Docker healthcheck passes
